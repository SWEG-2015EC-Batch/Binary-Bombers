A.10-49 pattern 

Problem Analysis
Input- The no input.
Processing-checking if the input for length and width are positive and If not, it outputs an error message and stops.
-If the input are valid, the program generates a rectangular grid of numbers starting from 10 and increment by 1 for each cell which is constructed using nested loops.
Output-A rectangular grid of numbers with each row separated by a newline character.
Pseudocode:

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables length, width, initialNumber
Step 3: input the values of the length and width.
Step 4:If length <= 0 or width <= 0, then output "Invalid input. Please enter positive values for length and width.", and exit the program.
Step 5: Set initialNumber = 10
 For i = 0 to length - 1  and for j = 0 to width - 1 ,
Output the values of initialNumber, " ",Increment initialNumber by 1 and respective output.
Step 6:- If initialNumber > 49, then output newline character
             - If initialNumber > 49, then break outer loop
Step 7: exit the program.
