Problem analysis

Input-no input.

Processing- using nested loops to generate a pattern of asterisks and spaces.

Output-  a pattern of asterisks and spaces in the shape of an inverted pyramid.


Pseudocode

Step 1: Start the program.

Step 2: Set rows = 6.

Step 3: To print a new line, for i = rows to 1 (decrementing by 1):
     - For space = 1 to (rows - i), print "  ".
     - For j = 1 to (2 * i - 1), Print "* ".
     
Step 4: exit the program.
