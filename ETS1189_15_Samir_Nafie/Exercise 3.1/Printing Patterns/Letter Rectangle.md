Problem analysis

Input-no input.

Processing- using involves nested loops and character manipulation to display a grid of letters.

Output-a grid of letters in the shape of a rectangle.


Pseudocode

Step 1:start the program.

Step 2: Set length to 4 & the width to 6.

Step 3:Set currentLetter to 'A'.

Step 4:For i from 0 to length-1 and for j from 0 to width-1:

  - Output currentLetter followed by a space.
  - Increment currentLetter by 1.
  
Step 5: If currentLetter is greater than 'X'

  - Output a newline
  
Step 6: If currentLetter is greater than 'X':

  - Exit the outer loop.
    
Step 7:exit the program.
