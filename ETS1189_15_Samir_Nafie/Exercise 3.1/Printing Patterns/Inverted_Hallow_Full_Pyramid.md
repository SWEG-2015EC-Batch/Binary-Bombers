Output- a diamond-shaped pattern consisting of asterisks and spaces.


Pseudocode

Step 1: Start the program.

Step 2: Set rows = 6.

Step 3: For i from rows to 1 and for space from 1 to (rows - i), Print "  ".

Step 4:For j from 1 to (2 * i - 1)

  - If (j == 1 || j == 2 * i - 1 || i == rows) ,then print "* "
    
  - Else, then Print "  ".

 Step 5: Exit the program.
