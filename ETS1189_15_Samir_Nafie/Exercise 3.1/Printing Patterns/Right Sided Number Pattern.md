Input-no input.

Processing- using iterative loops generate a specific pattern.

Output- a right-aligned triangle in a certain pattern of numbers.


Pseudocode

Step 1:start the program. 

Step 2: let n= 5.

Step 3:For i from 1 to n and for j from 1 to n - I, output two spaces to the console.

Step 4:For k from i to 1, output k followed by a space to the console.

Step 5: Output a newline to move to the next line

Step 6: end the program.
