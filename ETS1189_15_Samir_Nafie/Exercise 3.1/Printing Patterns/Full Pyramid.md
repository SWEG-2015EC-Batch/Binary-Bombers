Problem analysis

Input- no input.

Processing- It initializes the number of rows to 6.

-using a loop to iterate through each row. Within each row, using two nested loops to print spaces and asterisks based on the row number and position.

Output- a pyramid pattern made of asterisks forming a pyramid shape.


Pseudocode

Step 1:start.

Step 2: Set rows = 6 and for i = 1 to rows.

Step 3: To print a new line use,
       - For space = 1 to rows - I, Print "  ".
       - For j = 1 to 2 * i - 1, Print "* ".
       
Step 4: Exit the program.
