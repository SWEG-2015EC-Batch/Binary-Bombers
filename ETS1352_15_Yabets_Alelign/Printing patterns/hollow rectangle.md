Problem analysis
Input- no input.
Processing- using nested loops to iterate through each cell of a 2D grid.
- print "*" if the cell is on the border of the grid, and if it is not on the border, print "  " (two spaces)
Output- display a 2D grid pattern made of "*" and spaces.

Pseudocode:
Step 1:start the program.
Step 2: Set rows to 4 and columns to 6.
Step 3:  To print a new line For i from 1 to rows and for j from 1 to columns,
          - If i is equal to 1 or i is equal to rows or j is equal to 1 or j is equal to columns, then Print "* ".
-Else, print "  ".
Step 4: Exit the program.
