Output- a right-aligned triangle in a certain pattern of numbers.

Pseudocode
Step 1:start the program. 
Step 2: let n= 5.
Step 3:For i from 1 to n and for j from 1 to n - I, output two spaces to the console.
Step 4:For k from i to 1, output k followed by a space to the console.
Step 5: Output a newline to move to the next line
Step 6: end the program.
