Problem Analysis
Input - read input integer number.
Processing - defining variables as to store various by-products like the reversed number, sum of digits,product of even digits, factorial sum, Armstrong sum, and arithmetic operations to extract and manipulate number digits.
-checking whether or not  if the number is a strong number, a perfect number, a palindrome, the product and presence of even digits, the sum of the digits raised to the power of the number of digits and the sum of the digits raised to the power of the number of digits(Armstrong sum).
Output - different calculated results.
Pseudocode
Step 1: start the function.
Step 2: read input integer number.
Step 3: compute firstDigit, lastDigit, middleDigit, and swapNum.
Step 4:Loop for factorials and sum of factorials to extract digits from 'numberâ€™ for calculations involving factorials and their sum.
Step 5:compute strong and perfect number to output the result.
Step 6: Check for palindrome and output the result.
Step 7:compute sum of digits in the original reversedNum, the product of even digits to check for even digit occurrence,the frequency of individual digits and the Armstrong number.
Step 8: Output the number of digits, reversed number, sum of digits, and other previously calculated variables.
