algorithm
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Read File_Size_in_Bytes
Step 3: Compute the time required to transmit the file by dividing fileSize by transmissionRate
Step 4: Print output "It will take about <result_of_division> time in Seconds to transmit this file"
Step 5: Stop
     Analysis
Input: Read File_Size_in_Bytes
Processing:Compute Time_for_Transmission = File_Size_in_Bytes/960
Output: Print "It will take", Time_for_Transmission, “seconds”
